The config class can be used by including the Config.php.

The class can be instantiated by calling "new Config()". A file name variable is available for the initializing.
If not provided, config.txt in the local directory is used by default.

The instantiation will throw an exception if the file requested cannot be read or there is an error in the file.

Each line of the config file can be accessed by its name as well as updated.
